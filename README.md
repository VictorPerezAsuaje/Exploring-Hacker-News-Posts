# Exploring Hacker News Posts

Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.  

I will be using a dataset of 300.000 rows with different posts to determine the following:  

* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? 

* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
